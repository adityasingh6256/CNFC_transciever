# Abstract    

Capacitive Near Field Communication (CNFC) is a technology that enables communication between two devices through capacitive coupling, which is a type of electromagnetic coupling that occurs when two conductive objects are brought close together.

In CNFC, two devices communicate by modulating the electric field between them. The electric field is generated by one device and detected by the other. The modulation of the electric field can be used to transmit data between the devices.

CNFC is commonly used in touch sensors, where a capacitive sensor is used to detect the proximity of a human finger or other conductive object. It is also used in some types of smart cards and payment systems, where the card is placed close to a reader to initiate a transaction.

CNFC has some advantages over other types of communication technologies, such as radio frequency identification (RFID) and Bluetooth. It can operate over shorter distances and does not require complex antennas or power sources. However, its range is limited, and it may be susceptible to interference from other nearby devices.

Overall, CNFC is a useful technology for certain applications that require short-range, low-power communication between two devices.
